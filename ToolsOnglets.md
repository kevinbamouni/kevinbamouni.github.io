### Dash (python)

Dash is a productive Python framework for building web applications.
Written on top of Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js, Dash is ideal for building data visualization apps with highly custom user interfaces in pure Python. It's particularly suited for anyone who works with data in Python.
Through a couple of simple patterns, Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols that are required to build an interactive web-based application. Dash is simple enough that you can bind a user interface around your Python code in an afternoon.
Dash apps are rendered in the web browser. You can deploy your apps to servers and then share them through URLs. Since Dash apps are viewed in the web browser, Dash is inherently cross-platform and mobile ready.

### Xarigan by yihui (for the love of manga)

An R package for creating slideshows with remark.js through R Markdown. The package name xaringan comes from Sharingan, a d≈çjutsu in Naruto with two abilities: the "Eye of Insight" and the "Eye of Hypnotism". A presentation ninja should have these basic abilities, and I think remark.js may help you acquire these abilities, even if you are not a member of the Uchiha clan.

### xlwings: Python for Excel

xlwings allows you to leverage the power of Python from and with Excel:

- Automate Excel from Python e.g. to produce reports or to interact with Jupyter notebooks.
- Write macros in Python that you can run from buttons in Excel, e.g. to load in data from a database or an external API.
- Write UDFs (user defined functions) and leverage the power from e.g. NumPy, Pandas and machine learning libraries.
- Remote control Excel e.g. on a Bloomberg terminal or Windows Server via the REST API.

Everything works on Windows and macOS except for UDFs (Windows only). Note that xlwings requires a working installation of Microsoft Excel.
